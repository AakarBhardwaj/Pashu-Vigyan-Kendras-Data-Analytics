# Empowering Farmers Through PASHU VIGYAN KENDRA: Enhancing Livelihoods and Animal Productivity
## Problem Statement
1. Pashu Vigyan Kendras are initiatives focused on sustaining and enhancing animal productivity to improve the livelihoods of farmers. These centers play a crucial role in providing agricultural support and information to farmers.

2. The primary goal of PVKs is to increase animal productivity, thereby improving the economic condition of farmers by enhancing the quantity and quality of animal products like milk.

3. Currently, PVKs operate with a hierarchical structure, where the Gram Sakhis serve as a vital link between the PVKs and the end-users, i.e., the farmers. Gram Sakhis are responsible for selling food for cattle and interacting directly with farmers.

4. One of the significant challenges faced by PVKs is the absence of a formal process for collecting detailed purchase-level data. This includes information such as order dates, quantities of food bags sold, sales figures, and demographic data of farmers.

5. To address these challenges and improve the effectiveness of PVK operations, a structured approach to data collection and analysis is required. This approach will enable PVKs to gather essential insights into farmer behavior, purchase patterns, and demographics, which can be used to tailor offerings and enhance animal productivity and farmer livelihoods. Additionally, our approach can address the challenge faced by Gram Sakhis, who struggle to maximize sales and earnings due to the absence of detailed purchase-level data.

## Objectives
1. Creating a data architecture and then developing and implementing a structured data collection process to gather purchase-level data, including order dates, quantities of food bags sold, and sales figures, at each PVK.

2. Gather demographic data of farmers, including information on income, number of cattle, and other relevant factors, to understand their preferences and buying patterns.

3. Analyze purchase behavior to identify trends, such as preferred brands and pricing, frequency of purchases, and seasonal variations, to inform decision-making.

4. Use the collected data to personalize food offerings for farmers based on their demographics and buying patterns, aiming to increase adoption of nutritious food for cattle.

5. Promote the exclusive use of nutritious cattle food sourced from Gram Sakhis, discouraging farmers from using their own produce or purchasing non-nutritious brands. By emphasizing the benefits of these products for animal health and productivity, aim to establish a preference among farmers for nutritious cattle food from Gram Sakhis. This initiative will not only enhance farmer livelihoods but also increase sales for Gram Sakhis, benefiting both parties.

6. By enhancing animal productivity through personalized food offerings, aim to improve the economic condition of farmers and contribute to their overall livelihood improvement.

7. Improve the efficiency of PVK operations by enabling informed decision-making based on data-driven insights, leading to better resource allocation and service delivery.

8. Empower stakeholders with a comprehensive dashboard that serves to assist Gram Sakhis among others. This dashboard will provide valuable insights, such as preferred brands and pricing, frequency of purchases, and seasonal variations, enhancing their sales strategies and earnings.

9. Establish a data-driven approach that can be sustained over the long term, ensuring continued improvement in animal productivity and farmer livelihoods.
